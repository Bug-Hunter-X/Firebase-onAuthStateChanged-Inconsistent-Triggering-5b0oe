# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Inconsistent Triggering
This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener's inconsistent triggering.  The issue involves situations where rapid changes in authentication status or unreliable network conditions prevent the listener from updating correctly.

## Bug Description:
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is expected to trigger every time the user's authentication state changes (sign-in, sign-out, user information update). However, under certain conditions (high-frequency authentication events or network fluctuations), the listener may miss some state updates, causing the application to reflect outdated user information.

## Solution:
The solution implements additional checks and potentially debouncing mechanisms to address the issues of missed events.  Specifically, incorporating a mechanism that monitors authentication state changes independently and synchronizes them with the UI updates solves this problem effectively.
